Pretty woman,
walkin' down the street,
pretty woman
The kind I like to meet,
pretty woman
I don't believe you,
you're not the truth
No one could look
as good as you.
Mercy!
Pretty woman,
Won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman,
I couldn't help but see,
pretty woman,
that you look lovely as can be.
Are you lonely just like me?
Pretty woman, stop awhile.
Pretty woman, talk awhile
Pretty woman,
give your smile to me.
Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty woman, look my way
Pretty woman,
say you'll stay with me
'Cause I need you,
I'll treat you right
Come with me baby,
be mine tonight
Pretty woman, don't walk on by
Pretty woman, don't make me cry
Pretty woman, don't walk away,
Hey, O.K.
If that's the way it must be,
O.K.
I guess I'll go on home.
It's late.
There'll be tomorrow night,
but wait!
What do I see?
Is she walking back to me?
Yeah, she's walking back to me,
Oh, oh, pretty woman
